                        <h5>The Gist:</h5>
                        <p>RJMetrics is a data analytics solution (now 2 distinct tools, Pipeline and CloudBI) that helps online businesses consolidate and visualize data for easy analysis/collaboration. When I first got to RJM over 3 years ago, the brand and design foundation were pretty much non-existent. We were growing quickly, and desperately needed to lay down a design foundation that would connect to our core culture and stand the test of time.</p>

                        <p>Our brand/style at the time looked like something out of a Microsoft PPT. I  devised the cornerstone concept of using platonic solids as a representation and we built a brand around that we could all stand behind for years to come.</p>

                        <h5>Project Goals:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Establish a visual design language</li>
                            <li>Represent a fun culture that knows how to be serious (about using data)</li>
                            <li>Create a flexible, scalable mark to represent us</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>As one of my consistent main focuses during the last 3+ years, the RJMetrics marketing website represents multiple years of design and message iteration/evolution. It’s the longest running web design project I’ve worked on to date. I’ve written the lion’s share of our headlines and been responsible for concepting/collaborating on every iteration of the site since my hiring. It’s our primary center of marketing information and like most SaaS companies, our most utilized sales tool.</p>
                        
                        <P>Our latest release had a bit more complexity than previous versions, as we are/were amidst a fairly big change in our product strategy. With some engagement data in-hand and pretty majorly revised message changes ahead of us, we had a lot to do on an air-tight timeline. I crafted a messaging split and associating graphics, completely revamped our product section, tweaked our site architecture, refined our type-heirarchy, and migrated to a new CMS — all in a 6 week sprint.</p>

                        <h5>Project Goals:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Continue to make it clear what RJMetrics solves and stands for as a brand</li>

                        <p>The early stages of our product were lean startup at its leanest. The product was barebones in features and design, but still ahead of the curve for its time. It was more or less a series of dropped-in high-charts with some basic (and a few complex) transformations available in our chart builder. The over-arching goal was simple: create the most frictionless experience possible for business users to extract actionable answers from their data.</p>

                        <p>Our UX designer and I did a ton of research, created user-flows, wire-framed our faces off, and designed/built prototypes until we came to a good set of solutions in a singular UI —all in collaboration with members from each arm of the organization. I designed a more simplified and spacious chrome, crafted high-charts styling, a navigation menu, and chart-builder that presented a consistent analysis experience.</p>

                        <h5>The Gist:</h5>
                        <p>In the late months of 2013, RJMetrics was in a pretty cramped space in the Philadelphia Building and in a serious stage of growth —so it was only getting tighter. By the time we we're thinking about moving, our re-branding process was wrapping up and I had established a baseline look and feel we were proud of. I worked with our architects as the design representative and selected all the base styles including the color scheme, flooring, and many aspects of the overall office layout. I then also led the charge on art acquisition and placement.</p>

                        <p>Along the way, I was approached privately by our real-estate broker Dan Gummel, who was looking for a unique gift for our founders (who had since pushed fair amount of business his way). After some research, I presented the idea of a “living” mural - and he loved it. The idea was to take the Rube Goldberg style (that our founder Jake and I shared a passion for) and apply it to the development process we recently established for data flow. I enlisted the services of the very talented Sean Martorana. Together, we produced an original peice of art that was able to excite our founders and rally the dev team simultaneously.</p>

                        <h5>Project Goals:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Design an environment that represented our culture and new brand</li>
                            <li>Optimize layout for collaboration AND sound/noise control</li>
                            <li>Design/collaborate on/implement a piece of art that encouraged/rallied around our dev team</li>
                        </ul>
