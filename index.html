                <p class="about">I’ve been designing for 9+ years and worked cross-functionally with folks from every department of a growing organization. I’ve had the opportunity to grow my skills in SaaS, Boutique and larger shops alike. I've established design as a part of company culture and laid down style-guide frameworks that can be successfully used by any member of an organization. I’m a process-driven thinker who approaches design as a problem solver for the user, first and always. I’ve got a four-legged sidekick named Eleanor, and a long list of hobbies. Some can be seen on my dribbble or instagram. Scroll down to see some of what I've been working on lately.</p>

                        <h5>The Gist:</h5>
                        <p>RJMetrics is a data analytics solution (now 2 distinct tools, Pipeline and CloudBI) that helps online businesses consolidate and visualize data for easy analysis/collaboration. When I first got to RJM over 3 years ago, the brand and design foundation were pretty much non-existent. We were growing quickly, and desperately needed to lay down a design foundation that would connect to our core culture and stand the test of time.</p>

                        <p>Our brand/style at the time looked like something out of a Microsoft PPT. I  devised the cornerstone concept of using platonic solids as a representation and we built a brand around that we could all stand behind for years to come.</p>

                        <h5>Project Goals:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Establish a visual design language</li>
                            <li>Represent a fun culture that knows how to be serious (about using data)</li>
                            <li>Create a flexible, scalable mark to represent us</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>As one of my consistent main focuses during the last 3+ years, the RJMetrics marketing website represents multiple years of design and message iteration/evolution. It’s the longest running web design project I’ve worked on to date. I’ve written the lion’s share of our headlines and been responsible for concepting/collaborating on every iteration of the site since my hiring. It’s our primary center of marketing information and like most SaaS companies, our most utilized sales tool.</p>
                        
                        <P>Our latest release had a bit more complexity than previous versions, as we are/were amidst a fairly big change in our product strategy. With some engagement data in-hand and pretty majorly revised message changes ahead of us, we had a lot to do on an air-tight timeline. I crafted a messaging split and associating graphics, completely revamped our product section, tweaked our site architecture, refined our type-heirarchy, and migrated to a new CMS — all in a 6 week sprint.</p>

                        <h5>Project Goals:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Continue to make it clear what RJMetrics solves and stands for as a brand</li>
                            <li>Introduce two products and explain how they work together (or overlap)</li>
                            <li>Simplify the way we describe our product benefits to the new personas we'd developed</li>

                        <p>The early stages of our product were lean startup at its leanest. The product was barebones in features and design, but still ahead of the curve for its time. It was more or less a series of dropped-in high-charts with some basic (and a few complex) transformations available in our chart builder. The over-arching goal was simple: create the most frictionless experience possible for business users to extract actionable answers from their data.</p>

                        <p>Our UX designer and I did a ton of research, created user-flows, wire-framed our faces off, and designed/built prototypes until we came to a good set of solutions in a singular UI —all in collaboration with members from each arm of the organization. I designed a more simplified and spacious chrome, crafted high-charts styling, a navigation menu, and chart-builder that presented a consistent analysis experience.</p>

                        <p>Data Point Live: NYC was RJMetrics' first ever self-organized event. The core theme was based on a piece of content I had previously designed, called Data's Untold Story. I visited the space and created a mini-brand for the event series, a quick and dirty microsite for promotion, ads for PPC/other marketing efforts (mostly email), and any/all physical signage.</p>

                        <p>As data-driven as we are, it's still tough to quantify the benefits (brand or otherwise) of putting on events of this nature. We applied our learnings from the NYC event, and put together a more organized and successful version of the event in San Francisco in the fall of 2015.</p>

                        <h5>The Gist:</h5>
                        <p>In the late months of 2013, RJMetrics was in a pretty cramped space in the Philadelphia Building and in a serious stage of growth —so it was only getting tighter. By the time we we're thinking about moving, our re-branding process was wrapping up and I had established a baseline look and feel we were proud of. I worked with our architects as the design representative and selected all the base styles including the color scheme, flooring, and many aspects of the overall office layout. I then also led the charge on art acquisition and placement.</p>

                        <p>Along the way, I was approached privately by our real-estate broker Dan Gummel, who was looking for a unique gift for our founders (who had since pushed fair amount of business his way). After some research, I presented the idea of a “living” mural - and he loved it. The idea was to take the Rube Goldberg style (that our founder Jake and I shared a passion for) and apply it to the development process we recently established for data flow. I enlisted the services of the very talented Sean Martorana. Together, we produced an original peice of art that was able to excite our founders and rally the dev team simultaneously.</p>

                        <h5>Project Goals:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Design an environment that represented our culture and new brand</li>
                            <li>Optimize layout for collaboration AND sound/noise control</li>
                            <li>Design/collaborate on/implement a piece of art that encouraged/rallied around our dev team</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>The Gist:</h5>
                        <p>Devnuts was an idea sparked by Chris Alfano and John Fazio in early 2008. The founding principle was to create a collab/hackerspace in Philly and grow a community of freelancers in hopes of taking on better web-based projects for all. We needed a brand that would appeal to a younger freelance crowd, but would be approachable by all ages. In 2009 we opened the collab space at 3rd and Poplar St. and started making some waves in the budding co-working ecosystem in Philly.</p>

                        <p>As Devnuts grew in size and recognition, the core team started getting RFPs and client engagement leads that required a more refined and mature look. I wanted to keep the (still new) Devnuts brand untouched, but needed to address the list of potential clients/partners we’re amassing. Enter Jarvus Innovations. Jarvus is a service-based web-app and software (and previously design) company based in Northern Liberties.</p>

                        <p>I crafted a mark and style for both distinct brands, as well as all of the necessary collateral to market and maintain those brands. As the Creative Director at Jarvus, I also worked on/with a plethora of great local/national brands including: TEDx, Technical.ly (Philly), Christie’s Auction House, The Roots, and GPTMC (Greater Philadelphia Tourism Marketing Corporation). Since that time, each brand now has it’s own location (albeit next door to one another).</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Establish two distinct brands that could address different markets in the Philly tech scene</li>
                            <li>Strategize the growth and marketing concepts for each brand</li>
                            <li>Design and environment that could house both brands comfortably for students/client’s alike</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>I've been a fan of apparel (more specifically t-shirt) graphic design for as long as I can remember. For a while I even sold some of my earlier designs to local boutiques in small batches. Lately, I've been skewing towards type-based shirts but am always looking for a great concept to try out and print a few of. I get inspiration for this kind of stuff all of the time.</p>
